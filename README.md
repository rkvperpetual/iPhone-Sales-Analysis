# 🍏 iPhone Sales Analysis

Welcome to my iPhone Sales Data Analysis project! 📊  
This project dives deep into historical Apple iPhone data to discover trends, patterns, and insights using Python.

---

## 📁 Files in This Repo

- **`apple_products.csv`** – The dataset containing iPhone models, specs, and prices.
- **`iPhones Sales.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with all the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` – Data wrangling and analysis  
- `numpy` – Numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Plotting and data visualization  
- `Jupyter Notebook` – For interactive analysis

---

## 📌 What I Did

- Cleaned and explored the Apple product dataset
- Visualized trends like:
  - How iPhone prices changed over the years
  - Which features impact price the most (battery, RAM, screen size, etc.)
  - Model comparisons and category breakdowns
